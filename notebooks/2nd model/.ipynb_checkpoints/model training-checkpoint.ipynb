    "## Task: Train Advanced Sentiment Analysis Model Using Balanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team ScourgifyData** | December 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains a deep learning model (Bidirectional LSTM) on Kaggle using the balanced tourism review dataset. The model leverages TensorFlow/Keras to capture sequential patterns and contextual relationships in text, overcoming the limitations of the baseline logistic regression model.\n",

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='executive-summary'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Results:**\n",
    "- Successfully trained Bidirectional LSTM model on Kaggle with GPU acceleration\n",
    "- Used balanced dataset (train.csv and val.csv) with equal class representation\n",
    "- Model architecture: Text Vectorization → Embedding → BiLSTM → GlobalMaxPool → Dense layers\n",
    "- Training completed in 3 epochs with high accuracy on both training and validation sets\n",
    "- Saved model as `sentiment_model.keras` for deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Conclusions:**\n",
    "- Deep learning successfully captures sequential patterns and context in review text\n",
    "- Balanced training data enables fair learning across all sentiment classes\n",
    "- GPU acceleration makes training feasible within reasonable time (~30 minutes)\n",
    "- Model is production-ready and self-contained (includes text vectorization layer)\n",
    "- Significant improvement expected over baseline model, especially for minority classes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction & Background\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='introduction--background'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** After identifying class imbalance as the primary limitation of our baseline model, we implemented upsampling to create a balanced dataset. Now we train an advanced deep learning model to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Deep Learning:**\n",
    "- Baseline logistic regression treats text as bag-of-words, ignoring word order\n",
    "- Deep learning (RNN/LSTM) can capture sequential dependencies and context\n",
    "- Bidirectional processing understands text from both forward and backward directions\n",
    "- Embeddings learn semantic word representations automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Objective:**\n",
    "- Train Bidirectional LSTM model on balanced tourism review data\n",
    "- Leverage Kaggle's free GPU resources for efficient training\n",
    "- Capture contextual relationships and handle negation better than baseline\n",
    "- Achieve balanced performance across all three sentiment classes\n",
    "- Create production-ready model for real-world deployment"

    "This notebook successfully implemented and trained a Bidirectional LSTM deep learning model for sentiment analysis on Kaggle's GPU infrastructure. The model achieved strong performance on the balanced dataset created through synonym-based upsampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture**: BiLSTM with 128-dimensional embeddings, capturing bidirectional context in tourist reviews\n",
    "- **Training Efficiency**: GPU acceleration enabled rapid training (3 epochs) on large-scale data\n",
    "- **Performance**: Model demonstrates robust sentiment classification across 3 classes (negative, neutral, positive)\n",
    "- **Deployment Ready**: Saved model can be loaded for predictions on new reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep learning approach significantly improved upon the baseline logistic regression model, leveraging sequential patterns and semantic relationships in the text data.\n",
