# Portfolio Enhancement Summary

## 沒 Changes Made to ScourgifyData Portfolio

### Enhanced Landing Page Content

The Landing.jsx has been completely revamped with **actual project information** replacing placeholder content:

#### 1. **Updated Hero Section**

- Changed dataset reference from generic to "~7M Yelp reviews"
- Updated stats to reflect real metrics:
  - ~7M Reviews Dataset (from original 160+)
  - 2 Production Models
  - 100% ML-Ready Data (from 98%)

#### 2. **Enhanced Deliverables Section**

- Replaced generic descriptions with specific implementations:
  - **Data Preparation Notebooks**: ~7M Yelp tourism reviews processing
  - **Production Models**: Baseline LR + Advanced BiLSTM with details
  - **Interactive Portfolio**: Live testing interface

#### 3. **Detailed Data Preprocessing Pipeline (8 Phases)**

Each phase now includes actual process details:

- **Phase 1**: Yelp dataset collection with ~7M reviews
- **Phase 2**: business_id merge strategy details
- **Phase 3**: Data distribution analysis specifics
- **Phase 4**: Handling duplicates, missing values, normalization
- **Phase 5**: Star rating mapping to sentiment labels (1-2竊誰eg, 3竊誰eutral, 4-5竊単os)
- **Phase 6**: Specific text preprocessing steps
- **Phase 7**: TF-IDF (10,000 dims, bigrams) + BiLSTM embeddings + upsampling
- **Phase 8**: Model training details

#### 4. **New Preprocessing Techniques Card**

Added comprehensive breakdown of preprocessing:

- **Text Normalization**: Lowercase, remove special chars, URLs, mentions
- **Tokenization & Vectorization**: TF-IDF specifics (10K dims, bigrams, sparse format)
- **Class Balancing**: Identified imbalance, applied upsampling, 80-20 split
- **Feature Selection**: Sentiment label creation, removed unnecessary columns

#### 5. **New Model Comparison Table**

Side-by-side comparison of both models:
| Aspect | Model 1 | Model 2 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Algorithm | Logistic Regression | Bidirectional LSTM |
| Features | TF-IDF (10,000D) | Embeddings (128D) |
| Context | Bag-of-words | Sequential + Bidirectional |
| Training Data | Original imbalanced | Upsampled balanced |
| Use Case | Baseline benchmarking | Production deployment |

#### 6. **Updated Key Findings/Achievements**

Replaced metrics with real project achievements:

- 7M竊単rocessed: Reviews successfully processed
- 2 Models: Baseline + Advanced deep learning
- 100% Quality: ML-ready data
- 3-Class: Sentiment classification

#### 7. **Comprehensive Development Timeline (8 Stages)**

Detailed milestones with actual processes:

1. Data Collection & Setup
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing Pipeline (merge, clean, normalize)
4. Feature Engineering & Vectorization (TF-IDF, upsampling)
5. Model 1: Logistic Regression (TF-IDF features)
6. Model 2: Advanced Deep Learning (BiLSTM)
7. Model Evaluation & Optimization
8. Interactive Portfolio & Documentation

#### 8. **Team Information**

Three team members with specific roles:

- **Nada**: User & Business Data Specialist (data/users/)
- **Houssem**: Review Dataset & EDA Expert (data/reviews/)
- **Redouane**: Data Integration & Preprocessing Lead (merged datasets, feature engineering)
